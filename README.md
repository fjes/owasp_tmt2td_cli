In order to use the converter in a script I decided to add the possibility to
run the script as CLI tool.

The original script and test file is derived from [TMT2](https://github.com/OWASP/threat-dragon/tree/main/utils/TMT2TD)

A online demo of [OWASP Thread Dragon](https://www.threatdragon.com/#/) is also
available. In the release section in the Github repository there are installer
for local installation and on Dockerhub is also a predefined thing.

# Licence

The original licence of the [OWASP project is untouched](https://github.com/OWASP/threat-dragon/blob/main/license.txt).
This work is for my use and may or may not be useful for others.
